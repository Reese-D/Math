# This work follow along with Rosen's elementary number theory & applications textbook
Rosen's book has a problems list at the end of each section, this repo contains my solutions to all of these problems

You can view the .html files to follow along with my solutions. I show all of the relevant code snippets from the .hs file as well as some commentary describing my solution

## Chapter structure
Each chapter has multiple sections, each section has a .org, .html, and .hs file. The .hs file is a pure haskell file you can load and run from ghci if you'd like.
The .org file is used internally by me to generate the .html file.

The .html file is for anyone who wants to see my solutions and their explanations
